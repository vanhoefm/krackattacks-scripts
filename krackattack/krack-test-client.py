# Concrete TODOs:
# 0. Option to send plaintext retransmissions of message 3 (this is now easy to do)
# 1. More reliable group key high RSC installation test in the 4-way HS (see below)
# 2. Test for unicast replay protection
# 3. Retransmit the handshake messages?
# 4. --group --gtkinit is a bit unreliable. Perhaps due to race condition between
#    install the group key and sending the broadcast ARP request?
# 5. How are we sure the broadcast ARP indeed using a PN=1? We should monitor
#    this interface and throw an error if there is other traffic!

# TODOs:
# - Always mention 4-way handshake attack test (normal, tptk, tptk-rand)
# - Stop testing a client even when we think it's patched?
# - The --gtkinit with the 4-way handshake is very sensitive to packet loss
# - Add an option to test replays of unicast traffic
# - Also send replayed broadcast using a PN of 2 to avoid edge cases where
#   the client may always reject PNs of zero or 1.

# Futute work:
# - If the client installs an all-zero key, we cannot reliably test the group key handshake
# - Automatically execute all relevant tests in order
# - Force client to request a new IP address when connecting
# - More reliable group key reinstall test: install very high RSC, then install a zero one.
#   This avoids constantly having to execute a new 4-way handshake for example.

# After how many seconds a new message 3, or new group key message 1, is sent.
